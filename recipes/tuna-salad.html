<p>You really can't beat a classic tuna salad. As a kid, this
    recipe was often packed by my mom for school lunches. As an
    adult I often eat it wrapped in lettuce, sandwiched between
    gluten-free bread or flaxseed crackers.

    It's incredibly easy to make with canned tuna and few pantry
    staples - hooray for simple recipes!
